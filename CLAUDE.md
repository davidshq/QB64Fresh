# QB64Fresh - Claude Code Project Configuration

## Project Overview

QB64Fresh is a complete ground-up rewrite of QB64, a modern BASIC compiler. This is NOT a fork - it's a fresh implementation informed by analyzing the original QB64 Phoenix Edition.

## Directory Context

- **QB64pe/** - Original QB64 Phoenix Edition source (READ ONLY - for analysis)
- **QB64Fresh/** - New implementation (this project - WRITE HERE)

## Working Guidelines

### Code Style
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Document architectural decisions
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful names
- Include comments for non-obvious logic

### Logging Requirements
- Update AgenticLogs/ at the end of each significant work session
- Log format: `YYYY-MM-DD_session-NNN_brief-description.md`
- Sanitize logs: use relative paths only, no sensitive system info

### When Analyzing QB64pe
- Focus on understanding behavior and architecture
- Note design decisions (good and bad)
- Identify what to preserve vs. what to improve

### When Writing QB64Fresh
- Modern, clean architecture
- Well-structured, maintainable code
- Comprehensive error handling
- Testable design from the start
